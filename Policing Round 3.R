### Grabbing the questions and information we "care about" in the context of this study
ICareCES<-select(CES, CC22_307, birthyr, gender4, educ, 
                 race, hispanic,
                 multrace_1,multrace_2,multrace_3,multrace_4,
                 multrace_5,multrace_8,multrace_97,multrace_98,
                 UCC437,UCC438,UCC439,UCC310,UCC315,
                 pid3,pid7,CC22_300_1,CC22_300_2,CC22_300_3, 
                 CC22_300_4,CC22_300_5,CC22_300a,CC22_300c,
                 CC22_300b_1,CC22_300b_2,CC22_300b_3,CC22_300b_4,

                 UCC434_N,UCC435,UCC436)

### Gonna make a dataset of all the variables just for really easy univariate work if I ever want to do that
datasets <- list()
for(col_name in names(ICareCES)) {
  datasets[[col_name]] <- data.frame(ICareCES[, col_name])}

FinalUni<-datasets
rm(datasets)
FinalUni<-lapply(FinalUni,na.omit)
lapply(FinalUni,nrow)

### Now we're going to clean up the ICare Data, But in this case we're making an experimental condition a variable declaring how the individuals were prompted which we can use later with the Police Thermostat, but other than that we're going back to data cleaning Yippee :/
ICareCES<-ICareCES%>%mutate(experimentalcondition=ifelse(UCC434_N!="__NA__"&UCC434_N!="-1", "Positive", ifelse(UCC435!="__NA__"&UCC435!="-1","Negative",ifelse(UCC436!="__NA__"&UCC436!="-1", "Neutral", NA))))
ICareCES<-ICareCES%>%mutate(experimentalconditionNums=recode(experimentalcondition,

"Negative"="2",
"Neutral"="3"))

                        levels = c(1,2,3,4), 
                        labels= c("male","female","non-binary","other")),
# Labeling the "race" variable. Here you might also clean the "hispanic" variable but don't need to clean each of the multiracial variables at this point in time.

###Retesting our 1st Hypothesis, now that we've recleaned the data in a more "socially acceptable" manner (Not a jab, realizing it sounds like a jab), This is Online vs Print, but maybe I should also sort by local and national to make it a multi tri column

HypothesisOne<-data.frame(ICareCES$PoliceThermo,ICareCES$NewsPaperTypes)
HypothesisOne<-na.omit(HypothesisOne)
HypothesisOneGraph<-ggplot(HypothesisOne, aes(x=ICareCES.PoliceThermo, y=ICareCES.NewsPaperTypes))+geom_boxplot()

### Retesting some correlational stuff with the new cleaned datas
ProvenRelationship<-data.frame(ICareCES$race_labeled,ICareCES$PoliceThermo)
ProvenRelationship<-(na.omit(ProvenRelationship))
ggplot(ProvenRelationship, aes(x=ICareCES.race_labeled,y=ICareCES.PoliceThermo))+geom_boxplot()

#### Hypothesis 2 intitial testing, might want to return to this later, When we sort by those who also don't really watch the news, but will do later
HypothesisTwo<-data.frame(ICareCES$FriendsFamilyNews,ICareCES$Pid7NoLean,ICareCES$PoliceThermo)
HypothesisTwo<-filter(HypothesisTwo,ICareCES.FriendsFamilyNews!="Never")
HypothesisTwo<-filter(HypothesisTwo,ICareCES.FriendsFamilyNews!="Rarely")
HypothesisTwo<-na.omit(HypothesisTwo)
HypothesisTwoGraph<-ggplot(HypothesisTwo, aes(x=ICareCES.Pid7NoLean,y=ICareCES.PoliceThermo))+geom_boxplot()+ggtitle("Americans who occassionally+ learn about police from friends and Family: opinions on police based on Party Affiliation")

#### Hypothesis 4, we're gonna sort by networks and calculate that with Police Perception, shaboinger

#### Chisquare, DV, Race Gender are all gonna matter? slap it all in the same model Run Regression.... DV=Numeric, run a regression, difference of means. ANOVA, unless it's a count then it's a different ype of regression, OLS,  lm(), 
### lm( Dependent  ~Independent, data=data.frame), Regression works for multiple things 
###Facet Wrap, by Political Party and News
###Use TechReg/StarGazer for making sexy Regression Tables
###Quanteda and also Tidy text for text analysis
###Write a paragraph about regression
###Use Github
###What is R markdown, R markdown work with it in R Studio, Instead of jumping docs and code, integrate it all together
###HuggingFace, Absolutely Terrifying name, use that as an LLM
###Gpt For All, LLM space, OpenAI, pay to do things you want to do
###Baseline Free Version, API to automatically connect to it and give it information

###Resorting Hypothesis Four to be by political Party as opposed to just network
